Also it needs a function $f$ for the right hand side and a function $bc$ for the boundary conditons, here assuming the whole boundary can be described with a single function.\n",
    "### Solving the problem\n",
    "Solving the problem is straight forward from here, assemble the $K$ matrix from my notes on $\\textit{A simple Poisson solver}$, here named matrix. Project the boundary conditions onto the basis to identify the basis functions connected to the boundary points (control points on the boundary). $I$ will contain the indices for every basis function connected to the boundary in an array. Compute the right hand side and then compute the linear system using the Conjugate Gradient method resulting in $lhs$ better known as $u$. Here a lifting function is used by the nutils-function $solve$, see section $\\textit{Boundary conditions}$ for further details.\n",

Here $u_0$ is 0 at the boundary, i.e. $u_0\\in V$, meaning we find it by the same means as described in $\\textit{A simple Poisson solver}$. The lifting function $u_g$ should then obtain the value of $u$ at the boundary, what happens on the interior doesn't matter as we will see, $u_g\\in U$.\n",

For our testcase on the other hand, as we will come to, this will not be enough to integrate exactly as the sine function is not exactly represented by polynomials. Still, for now we are using the same amount of gaussian points."

    "$reduced\\_poisson()$ works in the same fashion as $poisson()$, but as our new reduced basis functions have global support we need to do the part with the lifting function ourselves. As described above we solve the system with $u=u_0+u_g$, where $u_0$ is 0 on the boundary and $u_g$ fullfills the boundary conditions. We construct $u_g$ in the same fashion as we did with $cons$ earlier, seting all elements belonging to the internal equal to 0. Note that $u_g$ is now represented using the original basis, but this doesn't matter as we are not going to invert this resulting matrix. We compute the $A$-matrix $a(\\tilde{N_i},\\tilde{N_j})$ using the reduced system, and the same for the integral including $f$, i.e. the integral $F(\\tilde{N})$.Now comes the difference, insert $u_g=\\sum_{j=1}^mN_ju_{gj}$ into your weak formulation, where $m$ is the number of the original basis functions. Then assemble the resulting matrix $A_{u_g}=\\{a(\\tilde{N_i},N_j)\\}$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$, $n$ the number of reduced basis functions and $j=1,\\dots,m$. Then we compute\n",
